## 👋 About Me

I am a **final-year B.Tech IT student** at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune, with a strong interest in **data analysis, machine learning, and AI-driven applications**.

I enjoy working on real world problems to create **useful, real-world solutions**. My focus is on building systems that are **clear, explainable, and reliable**, rather than just training models in isolation.

---

## 🎯 What I’ve Worked On

- Built **predictive machine learning models** for real-world datasets, including customer churn analysis on **100K+ records**
- Built **CNN model** for MRI image classification, achieving **91.06% accuracy** across 17 brain tumor classes
- Designed **end-to-end ML workflows**, covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and inference
- Integrated trained models into **backend-driven applications** using FastAPI and Streamlit
- Published a **research paper at INCOFT 2025** based on my brain tumor classification project

### 🛒 Customer Churn Prediction
**Predictive Analytics for Business Decision-Making**

- Analyzed noisy relational e-commerce data with **100K+ records**
- Performed feature engineering and trained multiple ML models
  (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
- Selected the best-performing model using systematic evaluation
- Built an inference pipeline using FastAPI and Streamlit

### 📝 Smart Task Planner — LLM-Assisted Planning System  
**Backend-Driven Task Orchestration with Controlled AI**

- Built a system that converts high-level user goals into structured task plans with timelines and lifecycle tracking  
- Designed REST APIs using FastAPI to handle plan creation, updates, retrieval, and persistence  
- Integrated an LLM strictly for initial task generation, while scheduling, state transitions, and data consistency are handled by deterministic backend logic  
- Stored plans and tasks in a relational database (MySQL) and exposed functionality through a Streamlit interface
